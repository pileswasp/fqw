<p>Queen’s Wood is an area of ancient woodland and dates from at least 1600, possibly from pre-historic times.  </p> 
<p>In the nineteenth century Queen’s Wood was known as Churchyard Bottom Wood, possibly because of the discovery of human bones in the west of the wood which were thought to derive from a burial pit for victims of the Great Plague of l665.</p> 
<p>The Wood was purchased from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners by Hornsey Council in 1898 and renamed Queen's Wood in honour of Queen Victoria. In November 1990 it was designated a Statutory Local Nature Reserve by the Council. The London Ecology Unit list it (together with nearby Highgate Wood) as a Site of Metropolitan Importance, their highest grading. In 1984, research showed a significantly greater number of ground feeding birds present in Queen’s Wood when compared to Highgate Wood. There have been recent sightings of the rare hawfinch (<i>Coccothraustes coccothraustes</i>) in February 1991 and April 1992. <br/> 
	<br/> 
	The northern portion of the Wood is crossed by a small stream which provides a diverse damp woodland community. Goldilocks buttercup (<i>Ranunculus auricomus</i>), wood sorrel (<i>Oxalis acetosella</i>), yellow pimpernel (<i>Lysimachia nemorum</i>), and square-stemmed St John's wort (<i>Hypericum tetrapterum</i>) occur here. Wood sedge (<i>Carex sylvatica</i>) and remote sedge (<i>C. remota</i>) are both frequent and there is also a small colony of great woodrush (<i>Luzula sylvatica</i>), but perhaps the most attractive woodland plant here is the wood anemone which covers the ground in white, snow-like drifts in the spring. (There are occasional patches of common dog violet (<i>V. riviniana</i>) and in one place only these are accompanied by a sizeable colony of the early dog violet (<i>V. reichanbachiana</i>). <br/> 
	<br/> 
	The great storm of 1987 brought down many trees. In retrospect this has actually benefitted the wood as the thinning of the canopy has allowed light to penetrate to the woodland floor thus creating a number of natural glades. By the northern edge of the wood, where the damage was particularly severe, two glades have been fenced to allow regeneration to take place free of trampling. The results have been dramatic, allowing succession from bare ground through rose-bay willow herb (<i>Chamerion angustifolium</i>) to bramble (<i>Rubus spp.</i>). Slender St John's wort (<i>Hypericum pulchrum</i>) occurs here in what may be its most central London location. Its showier relative, the tutsan (<i>H.androsaemum</i>) has also been recorded from one or two places in the wood but these plants have probably originated from nearby gardens where they are still occasionally grown as ornamentals. This may well explain the presence of isolated plants of gladden (<i>Iris foetidissima</i>).</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most exciting botanical find since the great storm was the rediscovery in 1990 of the broad-leaved helleborine (<i>Epipactis helleborine</i>). This was previously recorded from the wood by E.B. Bangerter in 1956. In addition to these notable native species, a wide range of alien plants occur reflecting the urban nature of the wood's surroundings. These include the yellow-flowered strawberry (<i>Duchesnia indica</i>) Himalayan honeysuckle (<i>Leycesteria formosa</i>) and Indian horse-chestnut (<i>Aesculus indica</i>). The wood has also been infiltrated by a hybrid swarm of the Highclere holly (<i>Ilex x altaclerensis</i>), which seems to be under-recorded in London. <br/> 
	<br/> 
	Fungi are also well represented, with 80 different types having been recorded from Queen's Wood. One of these is the death cap (<i>Amanita phalloides</i>) which was not recorded elsewhere in the borough. <br/> 
	<br/> 
	Grey squirrels (<i>Sciurus carolinensis</i>) are abundant here. They cause considerable damage to the trees, especially hornbeam, by gnawing the bark in the summer months. However, hornbeam are widespread and squirrel damage can sometimes be of benefit by thinning the canopy and allowing light to penetrate. It also results in much dead standing wood which is attractive to woodpeckers and other birds. More seriously, squirrels can strip hazel of its nuts and prevent regeneration. As a consequence it is rare to find seedlings.  A total of 76 species of spider have been recorded in the wood. </p> 
<p>In the centre of the wood is the site of the old paddling pool which provides food for the bats roosting in the nearby staghorn oak.  The 1930s pool, which was originally a pond, is used as a mini theatre in the summer.</p>
