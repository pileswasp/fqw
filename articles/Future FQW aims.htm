<p><b>Future FQW aims</b></p>
<p>Here are our main objectives for our activity in the wood, forged in partnership with the London Borough of Haringey’s conservation officer:</p>
<p>Planned management of the wood.  This includes cutting back some of the more intrusive holly and coppicing to allow more light onto the woodland floor</p>
<p>Continuing the Friends’ regular work in litter picking, cutting back unwanted seedlings (e.g. English Ash) and other conservation work including coppicing in co-operation with the LBH Conservation Officer</p>
<p>Continuing to co-operate with the tenants at the Lodge who manage the cafe and organic garden</p>
<p>Organising regular events in the wood and at the Lodge including events for children such as bat walks and story telling</p>
<p>Contributing to improvements such as vandal-proof litter bins and benches made from recycled materials</p>
<p>Supporting the use of the wood by theatre groups and appropriate art events</p>
<p>A major ongoing plan is to improve the paths and make the major ones disabled and pushchair friendly</p>
