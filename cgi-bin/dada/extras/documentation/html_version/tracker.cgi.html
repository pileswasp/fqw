<h1 id="Tracker---tracker.cgi">Tracker - tracker.cgi</h1>

<p>The Tracker plugin creates analytic reports of activity of your mass mailings. You can think of a mass mailing being a <b>campaign</b> if you&#39;d like and the Tracker plugin being what presents data on your campaign.</p>

<p>The activities that are logged and reported include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p># subscribers when a mass mailing was sent out</p>

</li>
<li><p># of recorded clickthroughs</p>

</li>
<li><p># of recorded opens/views</p>

</li>
<li><p># of unsubscribes</p>

</li>
<li><p># bounces, both soft and hard</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="User-Guide">User Guide</h1>

<p>For a guide on using Tracker, see the <b>Dada Mail Manual</b>:</p>

<p><a href="http://dadamailproject.com/pro_dada/using_tracker.html">http://dadamailproject.com/pro_dada/using_tracker.html</a></p>

<p>For more information on Pro Dada/Dada Mail Manual:</p>

<p><a href="http://dadamailproject.com/purchase/pro.html">http://dadamailproject.com/purchase/pro.html</a></p>

<h2 id="Birds-Eye-View">Birds-Eye View</h2>

<p>These reports include the above information in tabular data, as well as in a line graph, for past mass mailings to help you spot general trends. This information can also be exported into .csv files, giving you more flexibility, specific to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Individual-Messages-Campaigns">Individual Messages/Campaigns</h2>

<p>Along with the birds-eye view of seeing data of many messages at once, each mass mailing/campaign can also be explored.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Clickthroughs are broken down per # of clicks per link</p>

</li>
<li><p>Clickthroughs are also broken down by country of origin, displayed in both a table and map.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Message opens are also broken down by country of origin and displayed both in a table and map.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Bounces, both soft and hard bounces are listed by date and email address of the bouncee.</p>

<p>Clicking on the email address will allow you to view the data about the bounced message itself in the bounce handler plugin.</p>

<p><i>(No bounces will be recorded, unless you&#39;ve separately set up and installed the Bounce Handler plugin that comes with Dada Mail)</i></p>

<p>If you suddenly get a ton of bounced messages for a mailing from addresses you know look legitimate, there&#39;s a good chance that something seriously went wrong in the delivery part of a mass mailing. The reports that the Tracker plugin links to may help in resolving this problem.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>All this message-specific data can also be exported via .csv files that may be downloaded.</p>

<p>What&#39;s below will go into installing the plugin and advanced configuration.</p>

<h1 id="Installing-tracker.cgi">Installing tracker.cgi</h1>

<p>This plugin can be installed during a Dada Mail install/upgrade, using the included installer that comes with Dada Mail. The below installation instructions go through how to install the plugin manually.</p>

<p>The tracker.cgi plugin comes with Dada Mail. You&#39;ll find it in the, <i>dada/plugins</i> directory with the file name, <i>tracker.cgi</i></p>

<p>Change its permission to, <code>755</code>.</p>

<h2 id="List-Control-Panel-Menu">List Control Panel Menu</h2>

<p>Now, edit your <code>.dada_config</code> file, so that it shows the Tracker in the left-hand menu, under the, <b>Plugins</b> heading:</p>

<p>First, see if the following lines are present in your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code> # start cut for list control panel menu
 =cut

 =cut
 # end cut for list control panel menu</code></pre>

<p>If they are, remove them.</p>

<p>Then, find these lines:</p>

<pre><code> #                                      {
 #                                      -Title      =&gt; &#39;Tracker&#39;,
 #                                      -Title_URL  =&gt; $PLUGIN_URL.&quot;/tracker.cgi&quot;,
 #                                      -Function   =&gt; &#39;tracker&#39;,
 #                                      -Activated  =&gt; 1,
 #                                      },</code></pre>

<p>Uncomment the lines, by taking off the, &quot;#&quot;&#39;s:</p>

<pre><code>                                        {
                                        -Title      =&gt; &#39;Tracker&#39;,
                                        -Title_URL  =&gt; $PLUGIN_URL.&quot;/tracker.cgi&quot;,
                                        -Function   =&gt; &#39;tracker&#39;,
                                        -Activated  =&gt; 1,
                                        },</code></pre>

<p>Save your <code>.dada_config</code> file.</p>

<h1 id="Specific-Plugin-Config-Variables">Specific Plugin Config Variables</h1>

<p>These variables have defaults saved in this plugin itself, but encourage you to reset the defaults to the values you may want, instead in your <code>.dada_config</code> file, in the, <code>$PLUGIN_CONFIGS</code> variable, under the, <code>Tracker</code> entry</p>

<h2 id="Plugin_Name">Plugin_Name</h2>

<p>The name of this plugin</p>

<h2 id="Plugin_URL">Plugin_URL</h2>

<p>The URL of this plugin. This is usually found by default, but sometimes the default doesn&#39;t work correctly. If this happens to you, fill it out in this variable</p>

<h2 id="GeoIP_Db">GeoIP_Db</h2>

<p>This variable holds the file path to the location ofthe GeoIP database. The GeoIP database is a IP Address -&gt; Location lookup table, to quickly and easily figure out the location based on the IP Address.</p>

<p>This database is updated monthly and new copies can be obtained at:</p>

<p><a href="http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz">http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz</a></p>

<p>The database is licensed under the LGPL, so it&#39;s OK to ship Dada Mail with a copy of this database.</p>

<p>If you find it necessary, you may keep a copy of this database outside of Dada Mail and update it regularly and tell this plugin where to find the database to use.</p>

<p>For more information, see:</p>

<p>http://search.cpan.org/~borisz/Geo-IP-PurePerl-1.25/lib/Geo/IP/PurePerl.pm</p>

<p><i>This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available <a>&quot;/www.maxmind.com/&quot; in from http:</a></i></p>

<h2 id="GeoLiteCity_Db">GeoLiteCity_Db</h2>

<p>Like, <code>GeoIP_Db</code>, this variables holds the absolute file path to the City Geo IP database. Copies are obtained from,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.xz">http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.xz</a></p>

<h1 id="Compatibility-with-clickthrough_tracking.cgi">Compatibility with clickthrough_tracking.cgi</h1>

<p>The previous iteration of this plugin (tracker.cgi) was called, <b>clickthrough_tracker.cgi</b>. Do not use this old plugin with anything newer than v4.5.0 of Dada Mail. It will not work correctly.</p>

<h2 id="Backwards-Compatibility-with-the-redirect-tag">Backwards Compatibility with the [redirect=] tag</h2>

<p>Past versions of Dada Mail (before v4.5.0) used a different syntax for redirect URLs. The syntax looked like this:</p>

<pre><code> [redirect=http://example.com]</code></pre>

<p>This tag format is still supported, but consider it deprecated.</p>

<h2 id="Limitations-of-Redirect-tags">Limitations of Redirect tags</h2>

<p>One thing that you cannot do with the redirect tags, is embedd other Dada Mail Template Tags within the redirect tag.</p>

<p>This will not work:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;?dada redirect url=&quot;http://example.com/index.html?email=&lt;!-- tmpl_var subscriber.email --&gt;&quot; ?&gt;</code></pre>

<h2 id="Upgrade-Notes">Upgrade Notes</h2>

<p>The below is information for people who have used the <b>clickthrough_tracking.cgi</b> script in past versions of Dada Mail (before v4.5.0) and want to take advantage of the new Tracker plugin and also want to move over the old logged data.</p>

<h4 id="Importing-Old-Clickthrough-Logs">Importing Old Clickthrough Logs</h4>

<p>Data saved within the older, PlainText clickthrough logs would have to be moved over,</p>

<p>There is a script called, <i>dada_clickthrough_plaintext_to_sql.pl</i> located in the, <i>dada/extras/scripts</i> directory that will do this conversion. Move it into your, <i>dada</i> directory, change its permissions to, <code>755</code> and run it <i>once</i> in your web browser. It may take a few minutes to run to completion.</p>
