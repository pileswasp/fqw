<h1 id="Multiple-Mailing-List-Sending-FAQ">Multiple Mailing List Sending FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Multiple Mailing List Sending in Dada Mail allows you to create one message in Dada Mail&#39;s, &quot;Send a Message&quot;, or &quot;Send a Webpage&quot; screens to more than one Mailing List at one time.</p>

<p>Multiple Mailing List Sending has the idea of a host mailing list, which is just whatever mailing list you&#39;re currently logged into.</p>

<p>Partial mailing list sending, using Dada Mail&#39;s Profile Fields is supported.</p>

<h2 id="Using-Multiple-Mailing-List-Sending">Using Multiple Mailing List Sending</h2>

<p>Multiple Mailing List Sending is currently available in the, <b>Send a Message</b> and <b>Send a Webpage</b> screens. If it&#39;s enabled and supported, you&#39;ll see a field set labled, &quot;+/- Multiple Mailing List Sending&quot;.</p>

<p>Once revealed, you should be able to see a group of checkboxes, that will allow you to select one or more other mailing lists to send your message to. The host mailing list will always receive a copy of your message.</p>

<p>If you do not see this field set, you either do not have the feature configured to be enabled, or do not have an installation that supports this feature.</p>

<h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll need to be running Dada Mail with an SQL Subscriber backend. Any of them (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) will do.</p>

<h2 id="Configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Multiple List Sending is NOT enabled by default. To enable Multiple Mailing List Sending, add the following to your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code> $MULTIPLE_LIST_SENDING = 1; </code></pre>

<h2 id="Configuring">Configuring</h2>

<p>Currently, Dada Mail support two ways to send to multiple lists at once. You can configure which way you&#39;d like it to work in the config variable, <code>$MULTIPLE_LIST_SENDING_TYPE</code></p>

<p>The two types are,</p>

<h3 id="merged">merged</h3>

<p><i>(This is the default type)</i></p>

<p>The <code>merged</code> method collates all the subscribers you&#39;d like to send into one mass mailing, weeding out duplicates and sends in a, &quot;on behalf of&quot; style. You&#39;re basically going to send a message from one list, to subscribers from another mailing list and it&#39;ll most likely look that way to people who receive the message.</p>

<p>For example, all list settings (and tags, for list settings) will be from the host list, so if your host list is using SMTP sending, you&#39;re entire mailing will use SMTP sending.</p>

<p>The only tags that will reflect the list the subscriber may be subscribed on (if it isn&#39;t the host list) is the, <code>list_settings.list</code> and <code>list_settings.list_name</code> tag. The unsubscription, list screen and other links will probably reflect the list the subscriber is subscriber on, though.</p>

<p>This method is the faster of the two methods, but you don&#39;t have much say in which list a subscriber will be sent from. Because of that, it&#39;s highly recommended that you never use this method, without also enabling <b>Global Black Listing</b> and <b>Global Unsubscribe</b>.</p>

<p>Generally, this method will make all your Dada Mail List act as if it&#39;s one giant mailing list.</p>

<p>To use this multiple list sending type, add this to your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>        $MULTIPLE_LIST_SENDING_TYPE = &#39;merged&#39;; </code></pre>

<p>To Enable <b>Global Black Listing</b>, add this line to your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>        $GLOBAL_BLACK_LIST = 1; </code></pre>

<p>To Enable <b>Global Unsubscribe</b>, add this line to your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>        $GLOBAL_UNSUBSCRIBE = 1; </code></pre>

<h3 id="individual">individual</h3>

<p>The <code>individual</code> method mass mails all the mailing lists you&#39;d like to send to, on a per-list basis. Instead of one mass mailing that has subscribers from more than one list, each different list will be mass mailed separately, just with the same message.</p>

<p>Because of this, the messages will appear and actually be from each mailing list you want to send to.</p>

<p>The downside to this mode is that it could be much, much slower to create the mass mailings - to the point that this feature may not work as advertised, if you have large lists. Having individual mass mailings can also be very resource-intensive.</p>

<p>Global Black Listing and Global Unsubscribe do not have to be turned on, as you&#39;re basically sending to more than one list, at the same time. This feature also has the option to have, or not have duplicate messages sent, if a subscriber is on more than one list.</p>

<p>To use this multiple list sending type, add this to your <code>.dada_config</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>        $MULTIPLE_LIST_SENDING_TYPE = &#39;individual&#39;;</code></pre>
