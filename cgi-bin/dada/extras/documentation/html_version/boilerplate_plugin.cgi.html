<h1 id="Roll-Your-Own-Admin-Screen">Roll Your Own Admin Screen</h1>

<p>This should give you a good idea on how to extend Dada Mail&#39;s admin area to do.... anything</p>

<p>There is an example on how to make the actual admin screen + script, it&#39;s called</p>

<p><b>boilerplate_plugin.cgi</b></p>

<p>and should be located in the <b>dada/extras/scripts/</b> directory It should work right out of the box, upload it, chmod 755 it and follow the next set of directions to make it work</p>

<h2 id="Adding-this-Module-to-Dada-Mail">Adding this Module to Dada Mail</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll need to tweak the $ADMIN_MENU variable in the Config.pm file, $ADMIN_MENU is a reference to an array of hashes of an array of hashes, or somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Follow the pattern :)</p>

<p>Adding this right after the last array ref entry:</p>

<pre><code>         {-Title           =&gt; &#39;Boilder Plate Example&#39;, 
           -Title_URL      =&gt; &quot;plugins/boilerplate_plugin.cgi&quot;,
           -Function       =&gt; &#39;boilerplate&#39;,
           -Activated      =&gt; 1, 
          },
          </code></pre>

<p>will do the trick, as long as you uploaded <b>boilerplate_plugin.cgi</b> in the same directory as mail.cgi. It&#39;s better to give the absolute URL for these things, I think. Upload the revised Config.pm file and there should be a link for this very module. Pretty frickin cool, eh?</p>
