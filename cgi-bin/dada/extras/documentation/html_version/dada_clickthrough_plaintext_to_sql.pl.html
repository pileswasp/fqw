<h1 id="Description">Description</h1>

<p><code>dada_clickthrough_plaintext_to_sql.pl</code> migration script converts your Dada Mail List Clickthrough Logs from the Default backend, to one of the SQL backends.</p>

<p>The Default backend for the Clickthrough Log is going to be a plaintext file.</p>

<p><code>dada_clickthrough_plaintext_to_sql.pl</code> is to be used <i>after</i> you have reconfigured Dada Mail to use one of the SQL backends - you&#39;ll most likely do this via the Dada Mail installer. Once you have reconfigured your Dada Mail, none of your previous mailing lists will be available, until after you run this migration script.</p>

<p>This script may also be used, even though you have always run the SQL backend, since the Clickthrough Tracking extension have historically kept Clickthrough logs in PlainText format. The Clickthrough Tracking extension was superceded by the Tracker plugin in v4.5.0 of Dada Mail. So, if you are upgrading a Dada Mail, with an SQL from a version of v4.5.0 and want to migrate over your Clickthrough logs, use this script.</p>

<p>Before running this migration script, please make sure to backup your important Dada Mail files/information, most notably, the <b>.dada_files</b> directory.</p>

<h1 id="Configuration">Configuration</h1>

<p>No configuration will need to be done in this script itself. The permissions of this script simply need to be set to, <code>755</code>.</p>

<h1 id="Using">Using</h1>

<p>Visit <code>dada_clickthrough_plaintext_to_sql.pl</code> in your web browser, or run the script via the command line. Make sure to <b>only run this script once</b>, or data will be duplicated.</p>
